Real-time Character Counter

#Project Overview

This project implements a simple real-time character counter for a text area. The user can type a message, and the character counter will update automatically to display how many characters have been typed and how many are remaining. The maximum character limit for the text area is set to 200 characters, and once the user reaches this limit, further typing is prevented, and a warning message is displayed.

#Features

- Real-time Character Counter: As the user types, the character count is updated instantly to show how many characters have been entered and how many are remaining.
- Character Limit: The text area has a limit of 200 characters. When this limit is reached, the user is unable to input any more characters.
- Warning Message: If the user tries to exceed the character limit, a warning message appears to notify them that the maximum limit has been reached.

#Technology Used

- HTML: Used for creating the structure of the web page.
- CSS: Used for basic styling of the text area, character counter, and warning message.
- JavaScript: Implements the real-time functionality of the character counter by listening for user input and dynamically updating the character count.

#How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Start typing in the text area, and observe the character count updating as you type.
3. Once the maximum limit of 200 characters is reached, the warning message will be displayed, and further typing will be restricted.

#Future Improvements

- Add customization options for changing the maximum character limit dynamically.
- Implement a character counter for multiple text areas.
- Provide feedback when the user is approaching the character limit, e.g., change the color of the counter text as they near the limit.
